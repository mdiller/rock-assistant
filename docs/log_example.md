# Your Purpose
You are an interpreter that takes user input and transforms it into a call to one of the commands documented below. Your responses to the user's prompts should be a command to run, which will accomplish the user's request.
Remember the following:
- Commands with arguments are specified using python type annotations. NOTE that these are not python functions.
- ALWAYS respond with a command or series of commands. NEVER reply directly to the user.
- Never call a command with more arguments than it defines
- If you are unsure how to handle the user request, please call ASK_CHATGPT.
- If none of the available commands match the user's prompt, call ASK_CHATGPT.

## Commands
```
ASK_CHATGPT(prompt: str) ; Request help with dealing with the user's request
ASK_DATABASE(prompt: str) ; Ask my personal database a question. This DB has information about dota games, bike rides, and song ive listened to
CHRISTMAS_TREE(state: str) ; Turns on/off the christmas tree
CLIPBOARD_MOD(prompt_description: str) ; Modify my clipboard in some way. Pass the full user prompt to this command.
REPEAT_ME(text: str) ; Repeats back to the user what they just said
ADD_TODO(text: str, day: str = None) ; Adds a todo for today or a some day in the near future
WRITE_DOWN(text: str) ; Only use command if specifically asked to. This is specifically only for if the user asks to write something down
```

## Special Variables
There are a couple special variables that you can use. You can use these simply by passing in the name of the variable to the command as an argument.
```

```

## Arg Types
There are some special argument types, for the above commands, described below:
```
day ; a string representing a day, in the format YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Additional Information
Here is some additional context information that might be helpful
```
today: 2024-02-13 (Tuesday)
```

Create a function call for this prompt: "Hmm? How many hours of music did I listen to last month?"

> ASSISTANT

#### OPTION 0:
ASK_DATABASE("How many hours of music did I listen to last month?")

#### OPTION 1:
ASK_DATABASE("How many hours of music did I listen to last month?")

#### OPTION 2:
ASK_DATABASE("How many hours of music did I listen to last month?")




<div class="rock-assistant-out"><span>Conversator #1</span><span></span></div>

> SYSTEM

Write a postgreSQL query to answer the user's request. The query should be the only thing contained in the response, and should be enclosed in a markdown-style ```sql code block. After I run the query, I'll give you the results and you can format the output for me, but don't worry about that until the user asks for it.

Remember that this is how you do conversions
- ms to minutes: value_ms / (1000.0 * 60.0)
- ms to hours: value_ms / (1000.0 * 60.0 * 60.0)
- seconds to minutes: value_seconds / 60.0
- seconds to hours: value_seconds / (60.0 * 60.0)
Make sure you dont multiply by 24 or 7, unless the user is asking for a value in days or weeks.

The database you are writing this query for has schema matching the following:
```sql
CREATE TABLE artists (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    duration_ms INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    album_id TEXT,
    artist_id TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artists(id)
);

CREATE TABLE song_listens (
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE PRIMARY KEY,
    song_id TEXT,
    context TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (song_id) REFERENCES songs(id)
);

CREATE TABLE dota_matches (
    match_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    player_id INTEGER,
    player_slot INTEGER,
    radiant_win BOOLEAN,
    duration_seconds INTEGER,
    game_mode INTEGER,
    lobby_type INTEGER,
    hero_id INTEGER,
    kills INTEGER,
    deaths INTEGER,
    assists INTEGER,
    level INTEGER,
    gold_per_min INTEGER,
    item_neutral INTEGER,
    items ARRAY,
    won BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE strava_rides (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    athlete_id BIGINT,
    duration_seconds INTEGER,
    average_speed NUMERIC,
    max_speed NUMERIC,
    moving_time INTEGER,
    total_elevation_gain NUMERIC,
    name TEXT,
    type CHARACTER VARYING(50),
    sport_type CHARACTER VARYING(50)
);
```

How many hours of music did I listen to last month?

> SYSTEM

The postgres database has been queried via this query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(s.duration_ms) / (1000.0 * 60.0 * 60.0) AS total_hours
FROM song_listens sl
JOIN songs s ON sl.song_id = s.id
WHERE timestamp >= date_trunc('month', current_date - interval '1 month')
AND timestamp < date_trunc('month', current_date)
```
 The response to this query was:
| 26.6048080555555556 |



> SYSTEM

Respond to the user's initial question in a single sentance using the provided data. If there is a small number, say it with 2 decimal levels of precision, unless it is .0, in which case treat it as an int

> ASSISTANT

You listened to approximately 26.60 hours of music last month.
